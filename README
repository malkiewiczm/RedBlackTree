Example red black tree insertion with a test.

This is a "left leaning" red black tree, essentially a way of
implementing a 2-3 tree in the form of a BST.

Both random data and sorted order (worst case for normal BST) are
given.

The tests include testing the height of the tree as well as making
sure that all of the data can actually be found in the tree using a
standard BST traversal.

Compile with `make`

Run with `./main.app`
